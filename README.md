# M-M-Sorter
Sort your candy by color

Sort your round shaped candy by color using a Raspberry Pi (again) and a USB camera.
Libs contains the..."libraries" I wrote for this project.
Sorter is the main file calling all the shots!
The Raspberry Pi, USB camera, linear selenoid and Stepper motor should be placed carefully so that they can adjust and decide the falling candy path.
